            Most of the time the soul is separated from its inhabited body because of death,
            sometimes it's a failed <a href=body-swapping>body swap</a>, and some other types it's intentionally induced.
            <a href=soul-projection>Projections</a> can't ever result in a separation, as the soul stays in the body.

          <h2>Effects on the Soul</h2>
          <p>
            After a time range of 4 to 15 hours the soul's memory will completely fade away.
            Negative memories and trauma tends to dissapear before positive memories.
            After the memories fade away completely, the soul dissapears.
          </p>
          <p>
            A frequent effect of temporary separation is the dissapearance of trauma, and an improvement in mental health.
            When the separation goes for too long, the individual comes back with lesser emotional stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is inconclusive whether souls suffer when they dissapear.

          <h2>Use as Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Some cultures use soul-body separation as a last resort treatment for suicidality.
            It's normally avoided at all costs, as the risk of soul erasure is too high.
