        Are an intelligent herbivorous hermaphroditic species,

      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Their skin can either be covered with peachfuzz, or be
        completely hairless, and its color ranges from golden
        yellow to a burgundy red, depending on the ethnicity.
        The belly, lower front neck &amp; inner thighs might
        be a different color to the rest of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to size, they're a bit slimmer &amp;
        taller (1.5–2.2m) than humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have long, pointy ears that point back, and, depending on the ethnicity,
        upwards, downwards, or somewhere in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have horns, but they're really small, and their
        shape and size varies.

      <h2>Social Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        {People species} live in tribes/flocks/communes. They usually mix all the
        children in one group, and assign people responsible for taking care of them.
        In most cultures, the concept of caretaker is the equivalent to our concept
        of parent, and the biological parents have no special relation to their children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members if this species are usually disinterested in power for power's sake, and
        are highly cooperative. One of their most primary needs is to feel useful to their
        commune, which is what drives most of their innovation, conflicts and discoveries
        instead. If an individual can't contribute to their commune in any way at all, they
        may suffer severe mental health issues.

      <h2>Reproduction</h2>
      <h3>Mating</h3>
      <p>
        {People species} have evolved past hard-wired mating rituals, so partner
        desirability is dictated by each specific culture, and their own personal
        preferences.
      </p>
      <h3>Eggs</h3>
      <p>
        Their eggs start at around an 8cm diameter, and grow to around 20cm, which
        is made possible by having a slightly flexible membrane, that slowly grows
        by using up part of the protein stored inside it, while the embryo uses the
        rest to grow them-selves. They're usually red-colored.
      </p>
      <p>
        They typically store all of the eggs in a common place, and assign members
        of their commune the responsibility to care for and protect them, tho it may
        vary by culture.
