            A soul can be separated from its inhabited body for a multitude of reasons.
            Most of the time it's death, sometimes it's a failed <a href=body-swapping>body swap</a>.
            <a href=soul-projection>Projections</a> cannot result in a separation, as the soul stays in the body.

          <h2>Effects on the Soul</h2>
          <p>
            After a time range of 1 to 5 days the soul's memory will fade away.
            Negative memories and trauma tends to dissapear before positive memories.
            After the memories fade away completely, the soul dissapears.
          </p>
          <p>
            A frequent effect of temporary separation is the dissapearance of trauma, and an improvement in mental health.
            When the separation goes for too long, the individual comes back with lesser emotional stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is inconclusive whether souls suffer when they dissapear,
            but it is considered unlikely as all their negative and neutral memories, including trauma have left at that point,
            leaving them with only positive memories, before these run out aswell.

          <h2>Use as Therapy</h2>
          <p>
            Some cultures use soul-body separation as a last resort treatment for suicidality.
            It's normally avoided at all costs, as the risk of soul erasure is too high.
