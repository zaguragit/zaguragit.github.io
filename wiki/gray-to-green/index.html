        This is just an idea... A game where you transform a depressing, gray, modern
        town/city into a green, solarpunk utopia.

    <section id=setting>
      <h2>Setting</h2>
      The game is situated in a depressing, somewhat cyberpunk town. There are barely any plants,
      none of them produce food, and there's a lot of adds plastered everywhere.
    </section>
    <section id=lore>
      <h2>Lore</h2>
      The protagonist is tired of their life, so they start growing vegetables on the
      roof of their appartment building (where nobody would catch them) and then rent
      a shop to sell them.<br>
      At some point you get enough money to expand to the top appartment, and slowly
      your farm grows downwards till it reaches the floor.
      When you get your first farm appartment, you can start recruiting people to your
      cooperative, and they can recruit more people.
      When the cooperative is large enough, it becomes larger than you, and you can work
      on different things and make decisions in those areas, but you can't just decide
      what people working on other things do.<br>
      Eventually your coop will spread to other buildings and other industries, and
      slowly take over the town. You can start campaigns to convince people to vote for
      a specific thing (activism), but you can't just become a govenor or anything.
    </section>
    <section id=art>
      <h2>Art Direction</h2>
      Probably pixelart. The town is cyberpunk, but as the farm grows (especially in people),
      transition to a more solarpunk aesthetic around the whole town.
