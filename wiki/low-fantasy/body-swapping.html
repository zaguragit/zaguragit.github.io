        Body Swapping is the process of swapping the minds (or souls inhabiting 2 or more bodies).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=types>
      <h2>Types</h2>
      <p>
        There are 3 types of body swaps: Unidirectional, Bidirectional and Ring
      </p>
      <h3 id=unidirectional>Unidirectional</h3>
      <p>
        Not techically a swap, but the soul is moved from one body to another without moving another soul from the recipient into the origin.
        The recipient body could be uninhabited or have another soul (see <a href=#soul-cohabitation>Soul Cohabitation</a>)
      </p>
      <h3 id=bidirectional>Bidirectional</h3>
      <p>
        Actually a swap, the souls in 2 bodies change places
      </p>
      <h3 id=ring>Ring</h3>
      <p>
        A closed chain of unidirectional swaps, that occur simultaneously to not cause any two souls to be at the same body in the process
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=in-humans>
      <h2>In Humans</h2>
      <p>
        The practice of body swapping humans has been practiced by some religious sects that have discovered the <a href=mind-net>mind net</a>
        before mainstream scientists.
      </p>
      <h3 id=requirements>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Any person must receive extensive training before experiencing a complete body swap, to minimize the risks of side effects.
        Usually humans with preexisting biochemical dysphoria (usually trans people) are better candidates,
        since their souls have adapted to bodily incogruence,
        and can withstand the physical and mental side effects of body swapping better than their cis counterparts.
        However, they are still vulnerable to experiencing any of the possible symptoms, and must receive the same training before swapping bodies.
      </p>
      <h3 id=side-effects>Side Effects</h3>
      <p>
        When a mind starts inhabiting a new body, it can take a while to adjust to its conditions, or it could fail to do so.
        Very often, if a body swap isn't reverted for long enough, the following effects might occur:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Biochemical dysphoria</li>
        <li>Sensorial hallucinations</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Anxiery attacks</li>
        <li>Complete corruption (the soul is erased and ceases to exist)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some minds are uniquely adjusted to inhabit their own body,
        and a body swap could leave them paralized.
        Some less serious side effects include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Sleepiness</li>
        <li>Emotional instability</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id=soul-cohabitation>
      <h2>Soul Cohabitation</h2>
      <p>
        When more than one soul inhabits a body, the souls can either try to accomodate eachother or fight eachother.
      </p>
      <h3 id=fighting>Fighting</h3>
      <p>
        The original inhabitor of the body always has the upper hand in a fight, since they don't experience the the side effects of body swapping,
        but if they do start a fight, they can sometimes experience some of the light side effects.
        When a soul looses a fight it can be suppressed and put into a dormant state, or even erased.
      </p>
      <h3 id=coexistence>Coexistence</h3>
      <p>
        The more souls inhabit the same body, the more calories that body will need to consume.
        In addition to that, most of the time, the more souls are present in one body, the stronger the side effects of body swapping become,
        and they can eventually affect the original inhabitor too.
