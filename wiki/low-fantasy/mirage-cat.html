        <b>Mirage cats</b>, often called <b>mirages</b> are beings that take on any shape based on context.
        Their natural habitat is <a href=shortcut-world>Shortcut World</a>.
        The origins of mirage cats are unknown.
      </p>

    <section id=shape-shifting>
      <h2>Shape Shifting</h2>
      <p>
        Usually they take on a shape familiar to other creatures they see,
        so if a human walks by, they'll take tha appearance of humans, performing what at first glance seems like human activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way they know what that would look like is that they have limited access to any brain's image memory.
        They can see images, but can't know what they mean or what they are.
        They can guess what the species looks like in general based on what creatures in the images look
        like the individual whose memory they're reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a rare occasion, a mirage cat might take the shape of an object,
        so it's not advised to take anything around them, as you might be accidentally abducting one of their siblings.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=sustenance>
      <h2>Sustenance</h2>
      <p>
        Mirage cats feed on a sort of energy that the walls of <a href=shortcut-world>Shortcut World</a> release.
        Which means that they can't survive outside of their plane without a replacement energy wall.
        They can also free the soul of a lost creature that has accidentally
        shifted into the plane, and driven to a permanent state of suffering,
        releasing it into the walls of the world.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=social-behavior>
      <h2>Social Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Mirage cats live in herds of approximately 10 to 50 individuals.
        They are extremely defensive of their siblings, and remember any attacker's appearance forever,
        which gives them the reputation of being quite vindictive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one wins their trust however, they'll act really friendly towards them,
        will show some tolerance, and eventually even show their true form.
        Very few people have reached that level of trust with them, which is why mirage cats are often called mirages,
        as most people know them for being shapeless.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id=true-form>
      <h2>True Form</h2>
      <p>
        There's no concensus on whether mirage cats have a true form,
        as there's no difference between shape-shifting into a cat, dog or anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mirage cats in their true form look like a large cat, with little to no body hair, mostly peach fuzz.
        Their coloring is black, with light green or turquoise markings, and their elongated ears have blue tips.
        The tail on the other hand is as long as the distance from its base to the cat's head,
        and gets more colorful and slightly more hairy, as you go further from the base.
        Their eyes are bright and can be any color, and their nose is light blue.
        They are, approximately 70 cm in head-to-body length, and 40 cm in height.
