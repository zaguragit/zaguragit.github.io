            Shortcut world is another dimension that warps reality, where anything that is a door or a hole will take you somewhere else.
            This place is characterized by feeling like our world, but with only interiors, and no exterior.
            No one has ever seen the exterior of shortcut world, so we don't know if it has a sky like ours,
            if it's something completely different, or if there's no exterior at all.

          <h2>Breakout Attempts</h2>
          <p>
            Attempts to break out of the world's walls often result in the world warping, and the individual or object trying to break out falling somewhere else.
            But most commonly, they get electrocuted.
            Breakout attempts are the most common way to die in shortcut world as most intelligent species aren't immune to shortcut world's psychic effects,
            so if they spend too much time in it, they'll loose grasp on reality and enter a chronic state of anxiety.

          <h2>Mirages</h2>
          <div class=heading-note>Main article: <a href=mirage-cat>Mirage Cat</a></div>
          <p>
            Shortcut world is mostly lifeless, but on occasion one may see mirages.
            Mirages are beings that take on any shape based on context.
            They live in groups and are very defensive about eachother.
            Usually they take on a shape familiar to other creatures they see,
            so if a human walks by, they'll see mirages as humans, performing human activities.
            On a rare occasion, a mirage might take the shape of an object,
            so it's not advised to take objects around them, as they might see it as you abducting one of their siblings.
