          <h2>Setting</h2>
          The game is situated in a depressing, somewhat cyberpunk town.

          <h2>The Thing</h2>
          The protagonist is tired of their life, so they start growing vegetables on the
          roof of their appartment building (where nobody would catch them) and then rent
          a shop to sell them.<br>
          At some point you get enough money to expand to the top appartment, and slowly
          your farm grows downwards till it reaches the floor.
          When you get your first farm appartment, you can start recruiting people to your
          cooperative, and they can recruit more people.
          When the cooperative is large enough it becomes larger than you, and you can work
          on different things and make decisions in those areas, but you can't just decide
          what people working on other things do.<br>
          Eventually your coop will spread to other buildings and other industries, and
          slowly take over the town. You can start campaigns to convince people to vote for
          a specific thing (activism), but you can't just become a govenor or anything.

          <h2>Art Direction</h2>
          Probably pixelart. The town is cyberpunk, but as the farm grows (especially in people),
          transition to a more solarpunk aesthetic around the whole town.
