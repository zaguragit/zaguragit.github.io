              <h3>Coloration</h3>
              They can be any color, and it really depends on their self-actualization more than genetics

            <h2>Development</h2>
            Everyone starts out with a desaturated, greyish coloration, and really short, rounded horns.
            As they grow, they slowly self-actualize, and their traits become more unique. 
            Several characteristics are dependant on their self-perception:
            <ul>
              <li>Coloration</li>
              <li>Horn size/shape</li>
              <li>Height, to a certain extent (tho it's more dependant on genetics)</li>
            </ul>
            When they have an existencial crisis, or are emotionally going through
            a really difficult time, their body often reverts to it's un-actualized state

            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            Their eggs start at around an 8cm radius, and grow to around a 20cm radius,
            which is made possible by having a hard, but growable membrane
