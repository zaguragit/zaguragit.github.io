            Tooth fairies are intelligent humanoid rodents with wings capable of long distance flight.
            As they evolved from rodents, and their lifestyle doesn't allow for constant chewing,
            they get their teeth removed from at birth. They get new, replacement teeth through their symbiotic relationship with humans,
            especially their infants, who exchange their milk teeth for resources that the fairies find for them.

          <section id=tribes>
            <h2>Tribes</h2>
            Tooth fairies tipically live in large tribes.
            They are social creatures with a natural inclination for cooperation and empathy.
            They tend to divide them-selves by their specialty.
            The most common specialties are:
            <ul>
              <li>Tooth seekers</li>
              <li>Crafters</li>
              <li>Surgeons (the ones who implant the teeth)</li>
              <li>Home keepers (make art, take care of the tribe and its home)</li>
              <li>Gatherers</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section id=habitat>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            Tooth fairies tend to live underground, or in areas with complete lack of sun exposure.
            This is because they can't withstand uv rays.
            They tipically dig out or find a large main hole area for social gathering, healing places
            and anything else that would benefit from being accessible to as many individuals as possible.
            Then they dig tunnels connecting it to different places like farms, houses, and make the longest tunnel for the exit,
            to protect the base from the sun.
            The main area is then filled with bridges connecting the different tunnels to eachother,
            and platforms on which the different things that belong in that area would be placed.

          <section id=diet>
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            Tooth fairies are descendents of rodents, and as such, they are herbivorous.
            Their diet differs depending on the region.
            In more rural regions they feed of the environments plants,
            but in more urban places they steal food from food storages and make due with what they can find.

          <section id=tooth-exchange>
            <h2>Tooth Exchange</h2>
            The exchange of goods between tooth fairies and infant humans can vary depending on the culture and location.
            In capitalist societies, the fairies tend to offer money, which they steal from unprotected wallets.
            They don't understand or distinguish currencies, so while they do typically give local currency,
            they might swipe a coin from a traveller instead of a local.
            In more rural or less capitalist societies they tend to offer less money and more food, seeds or pretty objects.
          </section>
          <section id=human-encounters>
            <h2>Human Encounters</h2>
            Tooth fairies are extremely sensitive to sunlight, so they're never seen on the surface during the day.
            They tend to avoid humans, as at night they can look like rats, which could lead to agression.
            This is why normally the trading of resources occurs when the human is asleep.
            Actual sightings of tooth fairies are very rare, and because of the poor visibility during the dark and the fairies fleeing,
            some cultures think the fairies are mice, and others that they are more human-like fairies.
