      <section>
        Tooth fairies are intelligent humanoid rodents with wings capable of long distance flight.
        As they evolved from rodents, and their lifestyle doesn't allow for constant chewing,
        they get their teeth removed from at birth. They get new, replacement teeth through their symbiotic relationship with humans,
        especially their infants, who exchange their milk teeth for resources that the fairies find for them.
        In capitalist societies it tends to be money, which the fairies steal from unprotected wallets.
        They don't understand or distinguish currencies, so while they do typically give local currency,
        they might swipe a coin from an immigrant or tourist instead of a local.

        <h2>Tribes</h2>
        Tooth fairies tipically live in large tribes.
        They are social creatures with a natural inclination for cooperation and empathy.
        They tend to divide them-selves by their specialty.
        The most common specialties are:
        <ul>
          <li>Tooth seekers</li>
          <li>Crafters</li>
          <li>Surgeons (the ones who implant the teeth)</li>
          <li>Home keepers (make art, take care of the tribe and its home)</li>
          <li>Gatherers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        Tooth fairies are descendents of rodents, and as such, they are herbivorous.
        Their diet differs depending on the region.
        In more rural regions they feed of the environments plants,
        but in more urban places they steal food from food storages and make due with what they can find.

        <h2>Human Encounters</h2>
        Tooth fairies are extremely sensitive to sunlight, so they're never seen on the surface during the day.
        They tend to avoid humans, as at night they can look like rats, which could lead to agression.
        This is why normally the trading of resources occurs when the human is asleep.
        Actual sightings of tooth fairies are very rare, and because of the poor visibility during the dark and the fairies fleeing,
        some cultures think the fairies are mice, and others that they are more human-like fairies.
